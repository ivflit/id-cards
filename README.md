Mock up layouts for id cards

## What is my learning from this

By doing this project of mockup ID cards, I am strengthening my understanding on the CSS box model and becoming better at seeing layouts of certain designs for example being able to spot whether a design uses flexbox in some areas and CSS grid in others.

### Bulma

I will be using the CSS library known as [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) which does not use CSS grid for 2D layouts but instead uses 'Columns' which uses FlexBox as its foundation.
